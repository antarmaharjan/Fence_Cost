Defining the Problem
To solve this problem, we are going to focus into three separate components:

 
Input: wooden fence cost, chain-link fence,gates cost,tax rate,user inputs
Output:  display total cost, tax amount and  final cost.
Processing Steps: calculating perimeter,computing total cost, computing tax amount and final cost
 
 *Pseudo code
 * Begin
 Initialize the object "scanner"
 prompt user yardLength,yardWidth and totalGates
 Store inputs from user
 Calculate perimeter =2*(yardWidth +yardLength)
 prompt user totalGates
 Get input from user
 Calculate the total cost =woodenFence * perimeter + totalGates * gateCost
 Calculate tax amount=total cost *tax rate
 Calculate final Cost =total cost +tax amount +permitFee
 print the final cost
 End
